Learning Robot Framework (RF) has been one of my objectives in these first few months as that is entirely new for me. As I continue to learn and explore RF, I wanted to take some time out to share few things I have learnt.</description></item><item><title>Robot Framework 1</title><link>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/04/robot-framework-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 18:28:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/04/robot-framework-1/</guid><description>In my new job role as a Test Engineer, knowing how to use Robot Framework for Automating Test Cases is crucial, to save time and to make testing more fun! As I&amp;rsquo;m going through this learning journey, I wanted to blog about it for anyone who is looking to start this journey and also to help me understand things in a better way.
There are plenty of good resources out there which explains the Robot Framework and it&amp;rsquo;s components.</description></item></channel></rss>
