I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that if you have been exploring the network automation world, you would have come across &lt;a href="https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Nornir&lt;/a> already. And similarly there is a very good chance that you have also come across &lt;a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html">Rich&lt;/a>, which is in my opinion one of the coolest libraries out there! If you are someone who loves working in CLI, like I do, you will absolutely love Rich!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
