I feel like for us network engineers, working on a CLI makes our work more enjoyable so naturally, building a TUI(Terminal User Interface) to do some of the automation tasks was a no-brainer to me. I have called it &lt;code>Net-TUI&lt;/code>, a TUI application to do few network automation tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Network Dashboard</title><link>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2023/04/network-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 18:28:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2023/04/network-dashboard/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this blog post I will be going through how I went about building a Network Dashboard using couple of my favorite Python libraries, Nornir and Rich. I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure that if you have been exploring the network automation world, you would have come across &lt;a href="https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Nornir&lt;/a> already. And similarly there is a very good chance that you have also come across &lt;a href="https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html">Rich&lt;/a>, which is in my opinion one of the coolest libraries out there! If you are someone who loves working in CLI, like I do, you will absolutely love Rich!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
