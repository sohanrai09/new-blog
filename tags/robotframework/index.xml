I will be covering only the new things I&amp;rsquo;ve added for this Test Scenario when compared to my earlier posts, which can be found &lt;a href="https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/">here&lt;/a>. Test Suite begins by validating the network status on a particular device, this involves checking protocols such as OSPF, BGP, Interface Status etc. After ensuring network is in steady state, a configuration change is executed and after the change, network is validated again to ensure there has been no network impact.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robot Framework 2</title><link>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/06/robot-framework-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 19:02:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/06/robot-framework-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my first &lt;a href="https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/04/robot-framework-1/">blog post&lt;/a> as I mentioned there, I&amp;rsquo;m at a new job (well it&amp;rsquo;s been 2 months, so &amp;rsquo;newish&amp;rsquo;) and I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy getting to know the job(as with any job, there is a LOT to learn!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning &lt;a href="https://robotframework.org/">Robot Framework&lt;/a> (RF) has been one of my objectives in these first few months as that is entirely new for me. As I continue to learn and explore RF, I wanted to take some time out to share few things I have learnt. When it comes to network testing, it&amp;rsquo;s not always about testing features, protocols, it also involves testing the hardware components. In this blog post, I want to discuss one such test scenario. This particular Test scenario would be to restart a FPC numerous times and to check and ensure it comes back up to Online state. This is what we call a &lt;code>Negative Trigger Event&lt;/code> Testing. Now imagine having to do this manually, needless to say it&amp;rsquo;s a time consuming task, this is where RF comes into play.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robot Framework 1</title><link>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/04/robot-framework-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 18:28:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sohanrai09.github.io/new-blog/2022/04/robot-framework-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my new job role as a Test Engineer, knowing how to use Robot Framework for Automating Test Cases is crucial, to save time and to make testing more fun! As I&amp;rsquo;m going through this learning journey, I wanted to blog about it for anyone who is looking to start this journey and also to help me understand things in a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are plenty of good resources out there which explains the Robot Framework and it&amp;rsquo;s components. Best place to start would be the &lt;a href="https://robotframework.org/">Robot Framework Documentation&lt;/a>, which shows some interactive examples and very clear explaination. During my learning what I have come to realise is, there are lot of resources around Robot Framework used for Application Testing but there are not a lot of resources focused on Network Testing(or maybe I haven&amp;rsquo;t been thorough with my search!). That&amp;rsquo;s also one of the reaons for starting this blog, to give a Network Engineer&amp;rsquo;s perspective on Robot Framework and use the examples around networking to help us understand this better.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
